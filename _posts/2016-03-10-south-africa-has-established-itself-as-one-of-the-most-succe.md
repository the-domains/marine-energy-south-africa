South
Africa has established itself as one of the most successful countries in the
world to deploy renewable energy solutions. In a short space of time, the
country has become a leader in large scale solar and wind projects. This is due
to the government's adoption of the Renewable Energy Independent Power
Producers Programme.

This
has led to expertise and facilities in South Africa that lends itself to the
development of other types of energy generating technologies such as Marine Energy.
